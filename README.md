# Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## Project Description

This project is on Sorting Algorithms and the Big O notation, the former are algorithms used to put elements of a list in a specific given order and the latter is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a specific value.

## Requirements

- We did not use more than 5 functions per file
- All of our files use the Betty style
- We did not use the standard libraary
- All the necessary prototypes are included in our header file called sort.h

## Authors
